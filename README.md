Problem Statement:

One of the most common problem that a student faces as soon as they land on a new city or country is finding the food of their choice. Despite the plethora of restaurant options, generally students will start with home cooked food. With financial constraints students usually tend to find the grocery they need in the best price available in the market. The other common issue faced by them is choosing the stores near to their location.

Objective:

This project aims to assist users in buying groceries at the most affordable price or in the most convenient location possible, depending on their needs. The system will retrieve the desired product from the database and compare the pricing of the item from multiple retailers in accordance with the price stated. It also enables us to find the product details from the closest retailers based on the user's location. This system will also keep records of each employee of respective stores and these employees are allowed to add and update products for their specific store location.
