Grocery_Recommendation_System

Problem Statement:
One of the most common problem that a student faces as soon as they land on a new city or country is finding the food of their choice. Despite the plethora of restaurant options, generally students will start with home cooked food. With financial constraints students usually tend to find the grocery they need in the best price available in the market. The other common issue faced by them is choosing the stores near to their location.
